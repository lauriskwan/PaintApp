**Section 1 - What this project does**

This is the proejct to showcase what we have learnt Javascript using class, inheritance, coordinates and other functions.

**Section 2 - Challenges**

The challenges we face is the modification of the side bar, where some of the formatting is not easy to change to what we wanted.
The difference between canvas-draft and canvas-real also baffled us as it's not requried to be used in pen tool.
Adding the color palette was a changllenge because we trialed many ways find a place the palette.
Time constraint is also a major issue, there is just too many features we want to add.
